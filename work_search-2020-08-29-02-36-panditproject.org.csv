According to the prologue (sthāpanā), the play has come ""from the Deccan"" (dakṣiṇāpathād āgatam), and the actress' incredulity at this remark has suggested to several scholars that the Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi was the earliest Sanskrit play, or at least the earliest nāṭaka, to be composed in South India. What seems more likely is that the Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi predates the plays of Kulaśekhara (ca. 10th century).

The seven acts of the Āścaryacūḍāmaṇi are in the repertoire of Kūṭiyāṭṭam performers in Kerala. Old Kramadīpikās (director's manuals) and Āṭṭaprakārams (actor's manuals) are available for most of the acts.",""

Chitra Shukla describes it as follows:

""Three young men---Mārjāra, Barkara, and Tarṇaka---are allowed by a Dīkṣita to have free sexual relations with his wife Sthūlayoni. The Dīkṣita himself wants to make love to another lady. Barkata proposes to dress Tarṇaka as a lady and to send to the Dīkṣita. The Prahasana thus contains various rather disconnected scenes within this thin outline. Thus the three young men meet a Digambara monk who was caught red-handed when he was making love to a wealthy housewife. They also meet the Physician Vakradanta, the poet Tātajata, Dīrghaśefa, and Sārameya.""

""The Prahasana freely refers to homosexuality, masturbation, illicit love and contains highly improper descriptions of women. The corrupt ways and behaviour of the ascetics are satirized and ridiculed. The Prahasana has become a curious mixture of course, farcical buffoonery, and intellectual laughter. The humour springs from witty and striking dialogues, jokes, and sarcastic references to Physicians, Goswamis and monks of ದther sects.""",""

There are also two framing stanza, one at the beginning and one at the end, both in the anustubh meter. Brevity is paired with simplicity in this work. The verses are in easy Sanskrit, with no unusual grammatical forms or syntactic constructions. The work is very straightforward and lacks complex figuration. Appayya Diksita, the scholar who had such a profound impact on the alamkara discourse in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries has, by and large, refrained here from the use of ornaments of speech. The work is accompanied by an autocommentary that explains its plan: the first 8 or so verses sum up the Devīmāhātmya, and the remaining verses sum events from other sources on the goddess. the Varāhapurāṇa (verses 9–11), the Harivamśa (12–14), and the Bhāgavata (15–16), before concluding with a verse alluding to the relevant portion of a Vedic text, the Samavidhibrahmana (17). This design follows the expressed intention of showing that the Goddess won the praise of the trinity of Brahma (in the Devīmāhātmya), Śiva (in the Varāhapurāṇa), and Viṣṇu (in the Harivaṃśa and the Bhāgavata).",""

""The Gūdhapadabhaṅgaṭippaṇa was probably a collection of short comments on the Suśrutasaṃhitā. The work is quoted by Ḍalhaṇa and Śrīkaṇṭhadatta. The former rejects one of the interpretations of its author on the authority of Jejjaṭa. P. V. Sharma assumes that the work belongs to the eleventh century.""",""

He notes two points of similarity between Amitacākarar's work and ""a work on Kannada meter calls Guṇagāṅkīyaṁ (kuṇakāṅkiyam eṉṉum karunāṭakac cantam-e). One is that both works contain a second-person address to a woman (makaṭūu-muṉṉilai). The other is that both involve a ""submission to the assembly"" (avai-y-aṭakkam). Since the work is named for the Eastern Cāḷukya ruler Guṇagāṅka (Vijayāditya III), who ruled roughly from 843 to 887, the work is the earliest text on Kannada meter known to us, and roughly contemporary with Śrīvijaya's Kavirājamārgaṁ, associated with the court of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa king Amōghavarṣa (the Rāṣṭrakūṭas being the traditional enemies of the Eastern Cāḷukyas).",""

To our knowledge, the Saubhāgyacandrātapa survives only in a single Grantha script palm-leaf manuscript, now housed at the Oriental Research Institute at the University of Kerala, Kariavottom. The manuscript itself is incomplete, only the first two chapters (paricchedas) having come down to us today from a work that most likely comprised at least five chapters. Nīlakaṇṭḥa often acknowledges the authority of the Śivārcanacandrikā of Appayya, whom he describes as “our grandfather” (asmatpitāmahacaraṇāḥ), or rather uniquely, with the proud but affectionate “Our Dīkṣita” (asmaddīkṣitaḥ). In addition, the Saubhāgyacandrātapa is referred to by name in yet another Śrīvidyā manual composed by his younger brother Atirātra Yajvan, entitled the Śrīpadarthadīpikā or Śrīpadārthavyavasthā, which may now be lost, but had been recovered prior to 1942 by P. P. S. Sastri. Nīlakaṇṭha further informs us in his own paddhati that his elder brother, Āccān Dīkṣita, also authored such a text, entitled the Saubhāgyapaddhati, of which no trace has yet been found. While simultaneously presenting a digest of Śrīvidyā upāsanā suitable for an orthodox Brahminical Śaiva audience, the Saubhāgyacandrātapa undertakes the project of bridging the gap between the Śrīvidyā textual canon and the scriptural and ritual canons of the Sanskritic Śaiva Siddhānta tradition, a school of thought quite far removed from Śrīvidyā's earlier ritual and philosophical influences.",""
